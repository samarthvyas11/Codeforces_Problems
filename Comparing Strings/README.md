# Time Complexity:- O(N)

# Explanation:-
At first step check whether both the strings have same
lenght or not ,
If they are having same length than find the indexes
where they have different value 
If the count of indexes where they have different values
are two 
then swap that two indexes value in string1 ,if it is  equal to
 string2 then Output "YES"


else
"NO"
