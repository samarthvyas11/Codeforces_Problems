# Time Complexity: O(N)

# Explanation:

Let's assume an example we have three 1 ruppee coin and two  3 ruppee coin
    1 1 1 3 3
Now, to distribute 1 ruppee coin in pockets such that the a pocket doesnot contain 
the coin of same ruppee
so we required three pockets for 1 ruppee and two pockets for 3 ruppee (which is satisfied by any two pocket that have 
1 ruppee ) ,


So we have to calculate the highest frequency from the given frequencies of the coins.
